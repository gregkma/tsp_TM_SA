# Resolving the TSP with a combinatorial method using Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing 

Using the .py file, the TSP can be revolved using geopgraphical coordinates of a set of towns. 
Many functions aren't so well optimised but it works, if any of them are optimised feel free to contact me to share it so that the algo can be improved. 

The resolution is based on the following csv:

It is based on this paper: 
Yu Lin PhD Zheyong Bian PhD Xiang Liu PhD, Developing a Dynamic Neighborhood Structure
for an Adaptative Hybrid Simulated Annealing - Tabu Search Algorithm to Solve the Symmetrical
Traveling Salesman Problem, http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.asoc.2016.08.036

And two opt-swap function was taken and modified from the work of:
